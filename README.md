## What is pairing-matrix

* Its a tool to show git commits pairing matrix 
* Monitor your team's health
* Pair rotation

## What pairing-matrix represents?

* Darker the connections more commits pushed together.
* Red cirle around an individual shows commits of an individual.

## installation

`$ npm install pair-matrix -g`

## Usage

* Provide a regexp of your git commit messages in a file named config.yml
* There is a default regexp in case you do not provide any config file.
  Default regexp matches messages in this format- |story#|Pair1/Pair2| message
 
```
  cd /to your project folder
  
  //Create a config.yml and add your regexp matching to your git commit pairs.
  //For example,
  regexp: \|([\w]*)(?:\/)?([\w]*)\|   //this will match |Pair1/Pair2| format
  regexp: \[([\w]*)(?:\/)?([\w]*)\]   //this will match [Pair1/Pair2] format
  
  /* There is a default regexp. In case, you don't create config.yml file then
     |pair1/pair2| format will be used to match the commit pairs. */
```

### Now goto your git project folder and run,

`$ pair-matrix`

_Now you will see a server running on port 3000. Goto browser and hit localhost:3000._
_If you want to provide a port for the server, export a env variable(PORT) as_
`$ export PORT=somePort`

> In browser there is an option to choose weeks. By that you can configure the matrix to show data for those many weeks.
